				1. Initiatives & Brief Intro
			</div>

			<div class="text-body">
				&emsp; I used to spend a lot of time every browsing thousands of anime image every day. Since I am making anime clips and 3D anime scene modeling, I find it is very helpful to glance through others' works along the way to get some inspiration from these artworks (such as coloring, architecture, facial expression, object arrangement, texture, etc). After learning some of deep learning concepts by myself, I thought it might be a lot fun if I can implement / build Neural NetWork for practical usage. During my exploration, facial recognition of anime picture came into my mind. So I decide to try CNN architecture and see if I can really make this work.<br><br>

				&emsp; After spending approximate one month, I succeed in building a CNN architecture (Cascade CNNs) from scratch to perform decent face recognition for anime picture. At the beginning, I think it is pretty impossible for me to get this done because I was neither computer science major nor math major student (a psychology and Japanese major student from nowhere). However, the end result is a surprise for me and I decide to write this blog to share some of my thoughts and what I have learnt about this journey. (approximate 3000 - 5000 lines of python codes)<br><br>

				&emsp; If you are <b>not interested</b> in the mechanism of CNN and just want to see what it can do, <b>feel free to skip to the Presentation Section</b>.

				3. Prerequisite
			</div>

			<div class="text-body">
				&emsp; In order to understand the general mechanism of my Cascade CNN architeture, you probably need to have basic understanding of CNN (Convolution Neural Network). I am 100% sure that <b>GOOGLE</b> will explain this concept a lot clearly and can be easily understood. If you are curious about basic concept behind CNN, I recommend you to utilize the google search engine to learn this concept.

				4. Basics Behind Facial Recognition:
			</div>

			<div class="text-body">
				&emsp; Before diving into Cascade CNN architecture, I think it would be better to give you a brief introduction to concepts behind facial recognition. (Here we only focus on how to process output) <br><br>

				&emsp; Ignoring the specific architectures of CNN or other facial recognition mechanism, generally, CNN's output will be structured into 1x4 dimension vectors (x, y, image height, image width). x here refers to the top left axis along height of image. y refers to the top left axis along width of image. With these 4 different values, the mechine will be able to calculate and draw bounding-box around the target pixels which it considers to be "face".
			</div>

			<div class="bigger-header">
				5. CNNs Architecture:
			</div>

			<div class="text-body">
				&emsp; Simple CNN (2 convolutional layers + 1 or 2 max pooling + 1 or 2 fully connected layers) can fulfill simple task such as image classification. However, in this case, I am using CNN for facial recognition which means the output of CNN should be a regressor instead of classifers. Moreover, a simple CNN may not be able to capture all the features of the face to perform decent facial recognition. Because of these reasons, I have to find more complex Neural Net architectures. <br><br>

				&emsp; Different from a single CNN, Cascade CNN is consist of multiple simple CNNs and each of them is used to perform different tasks. If we unrolled the Cascade CNN, its architecture looks like the following:

			<div class="smaller-header">
				A. Detect CNN:
			</div>

			<div class="text-body">
				Concept & Processing CNN input:<br>
					&emsp; One of challenge for implementing this kind of architecture is how to process image input during training process. Of course, we cannot feed the whole image into the neural net since it is really difficult for CNN to "know" which part is the face if only a small part of our input picture is the face. To solve this problem, I crop out the part that only contains the face and marked it as a positive training sample. For negative training samples, I just loop through all negative images (background images that do not have faces in them) and sample 36 windows (randomly sized) for each image and store them as negative samples. Afterwards, we can concate positive as well as nagative samples and feed them into Detection CNN.<br>

					&emsp; Type: binary classification<br><br>
				Main Purpose:<br>
					&emsp; Detect CNN here is a binary classification CNN to tell whether a suggested box contains a face or not.
			</div>

			<div class="smaller-header">
				B. Calibration CNN:
			</div>

			<div class="text-body">
				Concept & Processing CNN input:<br>
					&emsp; Sometimes, the output from Detection CNN will be a little bit off, which means that Detection CNN selected half of the face instead of a complete face. Here, Calibration CNN is used to adjust the suggested windows that output from Detection CNN. For specific implementation, I used scaled matrix suggested by **REFERENCE PAPER**. I will not get into the detail of how this is achieved. (you can look at my codes for specific implementation). If you are interested in concept, I recommend you to read through their research paper.<br>
					
					T&emsp; ype: 45 classes classification.<br><br>
				Main Purpose:<br>
					&emsp; Calibration CNN here is a 45 classification CNN to adjust and scale poorly suggested window to fit complete face. Here I attach two pictures from a reaserch paper called "A Convolutional Neural Network Cascade for Face Detection" by Li et al. to illustrate the purpose of Calib CNN. (Blue is the suggested box by Detect CNN and Red is the same bounding box but adjusted by Calib CNN)

				C. NMS:
			</div>
			
			<div class="text-body">
				Concept: <br>
					&emsp;  NMS is a algorithm to get rid of overlapping windows. I will not discuss it in this blog since it is not related to the concept of deep learning.
			</div>

			<div class="smaller-header">
				D. 3-Sized CNN:
			</div>

			<div class="text-body">
				&emsp; As you may notice, in Cascade CNN architecture, input size of cascade CNN is increment by multiplication of 2 as you go deeper into the Neural Net. In first CNN layer, CNN takes 12x12 pixels image as input. In the second one, CNN takes 24x24 pixels image as input. And at last, CNN takes 48x48 pixels image as input. This allows CNN to process different detail of the image in different time step. For instance, the eyes and mouth is not clear in 12x12 pixels image, the CNN probably learn to distinguish faces by color, which may generate a lot false positive suggested windows. However, these false positive suggestion will be denied at later Cascade CNN since they accept more detailed image as inputs. (they can process the shape of the face, eyes and mouths)

			<div class="smaller-header">
				6. CNNs Layers:
			</div>

			<div class="text-body">
				&emsp; I will not get into details about CNNs layers. Rather, I will briefly discuss functions of these layers I used in CNN.<br><br>
	
				<b>CONV LAYER:</b>
					Applys a filter window (a lot less in terms of size compare to image size) on the image. While moving this filter on the image, it will do elementary-wise multiplication with image value and generate different feature maps.<br><br>
				<b>MAX POOL LAYER:</b>
					Reduce the size of the input image from previous layers. This technique is used for later conv layer to capture larger part of image with same filter size.<br><br>
				<b>CONV FULLY CONNECTED LAYER:</b>
					Instead of fully connected layers, I decide to use conv fully connected layers which allows CNN to be flexible with different size of input. (Say your fully connected layers take [batch_size, 128] matrix and convert it to [batch_size, 784] matrix. If you use only fully connected layers instead of conv_fc your Neural Net only can perform calculation only if the previous layer before FC layer has size of 128. Since in the real world, we always get different size of image, it is better in this case to implement conv_fc layer.<br><br>
				<b>BATCH NORMALIZATION LAYER:</b>
					Normalized the output from previous layer before feeding into next activation layers. Not only will prevent vanishing gradient problem but also will gitter training sample representation in the batch which may have some extra regularization effect.

				8. Future Revision & Possibility:
			</div>

			<div class="text-body">
				&emsp; One of way to build a better model is to feed more training samples into CNNs. However, generating these training samples and training them will be very time consuming. For now, I have yet to labeled anime images for training. I hope there will be some in future.<br><br>

				&emsp; As for practical possibility, this network can definitely help anime website to distinguish between background images and images with faces. In addition, we can take a step further to use another CNNs to classify the facial expression of each faces which provides another filtering options for website users.

				8. Next Up:
			</div>

			<div class="text-body">
				&emsp; I am thinking of using Bi-directional RNN with attention mechanism to build simple Q & A chatbot which is trained using Japanese anime scripts or Japanese movie scripts. However, finding training data might be a challenge. I will need to take some time to explore and see what I can find. Likewise, once I finalize the network, I will probably write another summary blog like this. Thanks for reading.
